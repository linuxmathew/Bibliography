    <h3>10 Things You Didn't Know About Albert Einstein</h3>

<ul id='sect'>
    <li>He never failed math. This is a popular 'fact' promoted on the internet, maybe in the 
        attempt to relate to genius. However, it is simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an
         average student but math was ione area where he excelled, unsuprisingly.
    </li>
  <li>He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn’t work out, Einstein could
       have become a violinist. His mother played piano so he had the love of music instilled
        in him—via violin lessons—at the young age of five.
    </li>
     <li>He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel’s first president, Chaim 
         Weizmann, died, Einstein was offered the position, but he declined.
    </li>
     <li>He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva Maric, he
          married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was, actually, quite a bad husband to his
           first wife in their later years. He had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved
            the entire family to Berlin without discussion, and treated her more as a servant 
            than a wife.
    </li>
     <li>He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn’t particularly surprising.
          What is surprising is the fact that he didn’t receive it for the general or special
           theory of relativity, but rather for the photoelectric effect.
    </li>
      <li>He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby. But by his
           own admission, he never made a particularly good sailor. In fact, he didn’t even
            know how to swim.
    </li>
   <li>He really didn’t like socks, and usually didn’t wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa, 
       he bragged about getting away “without wearing socks” while at Oxford.
    </li>
   <li>He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn’t known until the 1980s, but according to 
       correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in
        1902 called Lieserl. At one point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.
    </li>
   <li>His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his autopsy took his brain
        without permission. He eventually got the permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was
         fired from Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for over forty years
          before finally returning it in 1998.
    </li>
